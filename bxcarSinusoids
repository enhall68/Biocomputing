% script that forms 4 sinusoids of designated frequency and amplitude, combines the 4 signals into one composite signal, forms a
% spectrum of the composite signal, plots the composite signal and its spectrum, filters the composite signal at a filter width
% of 5, creates a spectrum of the filtered signal, and plots the filtered signal and its spectrum.
